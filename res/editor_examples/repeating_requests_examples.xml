<!-- This example document shows how you might use events to create a map where you have to use repeating requests to obtain Caesar's favour.
    What this aims to do is make Caesar lose favour more quickly when favour is high, but then the player repeating requests that can be rapidly
    fulfilled to build up favour.
    Though the player first have to build up a city that can produce enough to fulfill those requests that rapidly.

    For the purpose of this example, we will assume we have 5 requests setup.
    The first request, set to start at +2 years:
        16 wheat, 1 year deadline, 6 months extension, +2 favour on fulfilled, -1 favour on extension, -10 favour on ignored.
    The second request, set to start at +10 years:
        32 wheat, 3 year deadline, 12 months extension, +2 favour on fulfilled, -1 favour on extension, -20 favour on ignored.
    The third request, set to start at +12 years:
        8 wine, 3 year deadline, 12 months extension, +2 favour on fulfilled, -1 favour on extension, -5 favour on ignored.
    The fourth request, set to start at +12 years:
        16 oil, 4 year deadline, 12 months extension, +4 favour on fulfilled, -2 favour on extension, -10 favour on ignored.
    The fifth request, set to start at +12 years:
        16 weapons, 4 year deadline, 12 months extension, +8 favour on fulfilled, -2 favour on extension, -10 favour on ignored.
    
    What we want, is for the first request to repeat once every 2 years, but only until 10 years in.
    After that we want the new request to be the one that repeats, and since it will be the main way to get favour with Caesar, repeat as often as possible.
    That way, if the player wants to get high favour, they will have to ship loads of wheat, as you only get 1 favour per request.
    However, since it has a long deadline, the player can ignore it for a while if they don't want to worry about favour at that moment. -->
