             This is checking that the months passed since the start of the game is equal or greater than a random number between 4 and 6.
             Once the scenario starts, this number will be determined (say it picks 5), and it will then start checking if that number of months have passed.
             Once met, this event can trigger and start repeating.
             
             So in total, this basically means: This event start after 4 to 6 months, and repeats every 1 to 4 months after that. -->

	 Notes for this to work:
		Heliopolis must exist as a city on the empire map. (Custom empires are your friend.)
		Heliopolis must be trade-able. This trigger cannot change a city type between trade-able or not. Just adjust amounts.
		Heliopolis must buy wheat (if it sold it instead, then the amount would change how much it sells, not change it to buying.)
		In short, this works the same as demand changes that the editor can do,
			you can just now have as many as you want, and have conditions on them
