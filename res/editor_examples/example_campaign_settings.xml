    How to create a custom campaign:

    While the game does not have a built-in campaign editor, you can create custom campaigns by creating a new directory
    inside the "campaigns" directory of the game and placing the campaign files inside it.

    The new directory placed inside the campaigns directory will be your "base campaign directory".

    Each "base campaign directory" has the following structure:

    - settings.xml: This file. The campaign settings file. It contains the campaign title, author, and the missions and
      scenarios that the campaign has
    - scenario/: A directory where you place the scenarios for the campaign. The scenarios can be either custom maps
      or savegames.
    - image/: A directory where you can place images to be used on the scenario selection screen and mission briefing
        screens, as well as inside custom messages.
    - audio/: A directory where you can place audio files to be used on the scenario selection screen and mission
        briefing screens, as well as inside custom messages.
    - video/: A directory where you can place video files to be used on the scenario selection screen and mission
        briefing screens, as well as inside custom messages.

    When you have all the files in place, you can compress the "base campaign directory" into a .zip file and change the
    extension from ".zip" to ".campaign". The game will recognize the .campaign file as a custom campaign and will show
    it on the campaign selection.

    Do note that for the ".campaign" file to load properly, the "settings.xml" file, as well as the "scenario", "image",
    "audio" and "video" directories, must be in the root of the .campaign file.

    For example, if the uncompressed campaign directory is in "campaigns/my_campaign", the .campaign file CANNOT start
    with the "my_campaign" directory. It must start with the "settings.xml" file and the "scenario", "image", "audio" and
    "video" directories.

        The info on the "description" tag will appear on the campaign list.
        The campaign title will also be used for new scenario autosaves.

        Available attributes:

          used for new scenario autosaves.
        - author: Optional. The name of the user who created the campaign. If set, it will appear on the campaign selection
          list.

        The text inside the description tag will appear on the campaign selection list. It supports rich text formatting,
        but the text does not scroll beyond the allocated space.

        This empty missions tag is mandatory. It represents the list of missions.

        Available attributes:
        - starting_rank: Optional. The rank the player will start the campaign with.
        
          If not set, the player will start with the lowest rank available in the game.

          Available ranks, from lowest to highest, are as follows:

            "citizen", "clerk", "engineer", "architect", "quaestor",
            "procurator", "aedile", "praetor", "consul", "proconsul",
            "caesar"

          Please note that due to engine limitations the ranking is case sensitive, and
          must be written in lower case.

            A campaign consists of missions, each of which can have one or more scenarios for the player to choose from.
            If a player choose a scenario from a mission and wins it, the mission will advance to the next upon scenario
            completion, just like the original campaign.

            Available attributes:

            - title: Optional. The title of the mission. It will appear on the scenario selection screen.

            - video: Optional. The video file to play before the scenario selection window is shown.

                The video will be searched for in the following directories (in order):
                - <campaign directory>/video/
                - ./smk/ (if video extension is smk)
                - ./mpg/ (if video extension is mpg)
                Supported extensions: ".smk", ".mpg"

            - background_image: Optional. The image to show as the background of the scenario selection screen.

              Recommended size of the image is 640x400, a bigger image will be cut and a smaller one will not fill the
              display. If not set, the default small empire map background will be used.
              The image must be in PNG format and in the "image" directory of the campaign directory.

            - next_rank: Optional. The rank the player will advance to after completing the mission.

              If not set, the player will keep the same rank.

            - max_personal_savings: Optional. The maximum amount of personal savings the player can transfer from the
              last mission when starting the new mission.
              
              Can be set to "0" to prevent any personal savings from being tranferred to the new mission.

              If not set, the player will keep the same personal savings as when the previous mission ended.


            If the current mission only has one scenario, you can also use all tags that are available on the "scenario" tag.

            See examples below.

            The following mission has two scenarios for the user to choose from. Beating the chosen scenario will advance
            to the next mission without the need to play the remaining scenarios of the same mission.The mission title
            will appear on the scenario selection screen and the video will play before the scenario selection window is shown.
        -->
        <mission title="The first custom mission" video="Credits.mpg" next_rank="clerk">

            <!--
                A mission scenario. A scenario can either be a custom map on ".map" or ".mapx" format, or a savegame in
                ".sav" or ".svx" format.

                Available attributes:

                - file: Mandatory. The file path of the scenario.
                
                  It can be a custom map or a savegame. It must be placed inside the "scenario" directory of the campaign
                  directory.

                  If the campaign file is already compressed (i.e. the settings are loaded from a .campaign file), the
                  game checks if the file exists and throws an error if it doesn't find it.

                  This behaviour does NOT happen if the campaign is not yet in a proper .campaign file (i.e. it is in the
                  "campaigns/<campaign name>" directory, to prevent easier new campaign development).

                - name: Optional. The name of the scenario.
                
                  It will appear on the scenario selection screen and also on new campaign scenario autosaves. If a name
                  is not provided, it will set "Scenario #" as default, where "#" is the internal scenario ID in the campaign.

                - description: Optional. The description of the scenario.

                  It will appear on the scenario selection screen.

                - fanfare: Optional. The fanfare sound to play when the scenario is selected.

                  If set to "peaceful" or "military", the game will play the default fanfare for peaceful or military scenarios.

                  If set to "none", no fanfare will be played.

                  If set to anything else, the game will look for the file in the following directories (in order):

                    - <campaign directory>/audio/
                    - ./community/audio/
                    - ./wavs/
                    - ./mp3/

                  Supported audio files: mp3, wav.

                - x: Optional. The X coordinate of the scenario button on the scenario selection screen.
                
                    If not set, the game will place the scenario button on the left of the map.

                - y: Optional. The Y coordinate of the scenario button on the scenario selection screen.

                    If not set, the game will place the scenario button on the top of the map.


                If you want a  mission briefing window to appear like on the original campaign, you must set the
                intro message on the scenario editor. If you do, the briefing window will appear even on campaign scenarios
                that use savegames instead of new scenarios.


                If you want a custom victory screen to appear like on the original campaign, you must set the victory
                message on the scenario editor. If you do, the custom victory window will appear instead of the default
                one. Note that if you create a custom victory message but don't set a video playback file to the that
                message, no victory video will play.
